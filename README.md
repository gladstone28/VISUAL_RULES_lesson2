# VISUAL RULES

### Font Family

If youâ€™ve ever used word processing software, like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, chances are that you probably also used a feature that allowed you to change the font you were typing in. Font refers to the technical term typeface, or font family.

To change the typeface of text on your web page, you can use the font-family property.

```
h1 {
  font-family: Garamond;
}

```
